# Box Office Mojo Box Office Revenue Analysis

Project Proposal Template

A movie producer has engaged CMCAnalytics to compete a data science project to answer this question.  Due to the pandemic, our client wants understand the genres important to focus on in the future to maximize revenue at the box office. Can we predict what movie genre will produce the most daily revenue at the box office?  The movie producer will use this information to determine what movies to produce in the coming years for their company.

Metrics on www.boxofficemojo.com will be used for this analysis.  Data will be scraped using Beautiful Soup and potentially Selenium.  T

The features of the data set we expect to work with are genre, day of the week for daily box office revenue, budget, movie title, language, country of origin, brand, franchise, and release date. 
A linear regression model will be used to analyze the data.  Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used for visualization.
