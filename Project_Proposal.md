# Box Office Mojo Revenue Analysis

A movie producer has engaged CMCAnalytics, AKA Cheryl McGowan, to complete a data science project to figure out how to maximize future movie box office revenue.  Due to the pandemic, movie tastes may be changing, the client is specifically interested in which genres the movie going public is interested in seeing. Can we predict what movie genre will produce the most daily revenue at the box office?  The movie producer will use this information to guide decision making on which movies to produce in the coming years for their company. 

### Data
Metrics on www.boxofficemojo.com will be used for this analysis.  Data will be scraped using Beautiful Soup and potentially Selenium.  

### Features and Target
The features of the data set we expect to work with are genre, day of the week for daily box office revenue, budget, movie title, language, country of origin, brand, franchise, and release date. 

The target will be daily box office revenue.

### Model and Tools
- A linear regression model will be used to analyze the data  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used for visualization
- At this time there are no plans to utilize additional tools beyond what has been identified  

### MVP
The MVP goal of this project is one data visualization showing the prediction of which genres will produce the most daily box office revenue.

At this time there are no plans to utilize additional tools beyond what has been identified.
