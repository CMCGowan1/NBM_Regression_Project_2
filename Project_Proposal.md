# Box Office Mojo Revenue Analysis

A movie producer has engaged CMCAnalytics, AKA Cheryl McGowan, to complete a data science project to figure out how to maximize future movie box office revenue.  Due to the pandemic, movie tastes may be changing, the client is specifically interested in which genres the movie going public is interested in seeing. Given the pandemic, can we predict what movie genre will produce the most daily revenue at the box office?  The movie producer will use this information to guide decision making on which movies to produce in the coming years for their company. Additional insight may be available on which brands or franchises to partner with in order to bring new movies to market and what day of the week is most impactful to release a certain genre.

### Data
