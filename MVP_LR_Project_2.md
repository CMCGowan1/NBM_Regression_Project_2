Outline:
To start exploring this goal, I used a linear regression model with one feature, genre, to describe how genre effects on Box Office Total Worldwide Gross.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
